A project that is still in heavy, if slow, development.

The idea behind NLP-Graph is that information is naturally structured and the experience of that structure, for any entity, is a sequence of patterns.  The plan is to implement the Smith-Waterman algorithm in OpenCL, run on clusters, and build a navigable database of patterns and pattern exceptions.  The ideal solution will consume fewer resources as the database flushes out, only encoding pattern exceptions.  The sequence of patterns may be recursively evaluated so that increasingly abstract patterns make it into the datastore.  The mid-term result and objective of this project is to have a database engine to generate the pattern store.  I'm putting it here to show some OpenCL, BOOST, and C++ chops...but mind you, it does not yet provide any value.
